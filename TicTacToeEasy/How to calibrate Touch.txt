Calibration of the Display

We will use the "touchscreendemo" example that comes with the library for calibration

File -> Examples -> TouchScreen -> touchscreendemo

Upload the example code to the Arduino

Then open the serial monitor

Click on the top left corner of the display and get the X and Y values

Then enter these values at these variables on the shared source code

X value = TS_MAXX 1023  79

Y value = TS_MAXY   548

Click on the bottom right corner of the display and enter the values in the
 TS_MINX 1023
and 
TS_MINY 535
variables

The 1display calibrated for shared source code and its ready to use
